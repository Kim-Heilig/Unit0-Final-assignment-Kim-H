Unit0-Final-assignment-Kim-H


This assignment represents a framework of an imaginary app... One that I might use and find useful if it existed.  

***********  Assignment  ***********

There are two main parts of this assignment:
1. The first part is using the skills from each module and applying those skills to different functions of the app for its creation or update.

2. The second part of the assignment are written examples to represent one use case of skills from each module.

***********  Idea  ***********

Lately I have been focusing on life changes, career shift, mindset, lifestyle habits, etc.  One of my resources for insight, motivation and practical applications has been the wisdom espoused through TED talks.  Those speeches and insight Resonate with me.  I'm calling my app ResonaTED.  Its purpose is to use criteria of my goals, interests and limitations (time), to suggest a steady diet of TED talks and a running library of useful videos for me.  Future applications can be designed around the concept of any individual TED talk and a way of tracking applying the wisdom to daily living. (That is just to show area of expansion/growth).

***********  Pitch  ***********

App Concept: ResonaTED

**ResonaTED** is a smart recommendation app that helps users discover TED Talks based on what resonates with them: their interests, time availability, and mood. Features may include:

- Filtering talks by category (e.g., mental health, creativity, leadership)
- A surprise-me button for inspiration
- Custom playlists and progress tracking
- A list to return to for re-inspiration

***********  Applying Lesson material to app function  ***********
---

Included is sample code for one use case from each Unit 0 module, including:

Values, Data Types, Operations  - Work with strings, numbers, math operations
Stringing Characters Together   - Building personalized messages with strings  
Control Structures & Logic      - Using if/else to recommend based on time
Working with Loops              - Looping through a TED Talk list with `forEach()`
Building Arrays                 - Creating and logging category-based arrays
Using Arrays                    - Adding to arrays, checking length 


All code is commented with:

- Pseudocode outlining the logic
- `console.log()` statements to test behavior
- Comments labeling the skill being demonstrated

****!!!!  This had to be run through the Terminal and not Visual Studio Code.  I can not get readline-sync to work through VS Code, so I use the command node (filename) to run the code through the terminal.
